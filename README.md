The original versions of my polyfill service have been greatly surpassed by [Financial Times’ most excellent fork](https://github.com/Financial-Times/polyfill-service). I love it so much, I endorse it as the defacto repository.

Since FT’s version is written in Node, I am interested in creating a fork for PHP and WordPress developers. Please [contact me](https://twitter.com/jon_neal) if you are interested in working on this new project with me.
